## Commit Size

> Code commit guidelines

### Code commit

When working on a feature, bugfix, hotfix or any other code related work. It is important to keep to a code commit:

- Related to the feature, bugfix or hotfix
- Small and concise

The reason for these two are, with following proper branching strategies, you keep all work independent of the whole of the project. This makes it much easier to trace the origin of issues, and empowers teams to find and fix issues quickly.

Keeping code commits small is important. It allows PRs to be reviewed faster and on a much more regular basis. This encourages learning and improves the velocity of teams as members will not have idle time waiting for a PR to be reviewed due to large commits that takes the reviewers a day or two to review properly.

### Rule of thumb

A good commit size rule of thumb: If a reviewer requires more than 2 hours to review properly, it is too large.

Keeping commit sizes concise with descriptive commit messages will allow reviewers to gain context of the change and review the changes quickly.
